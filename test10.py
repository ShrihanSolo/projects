list = [Newton\'s first law of motion states that an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion remains in motion with the same velocity unless acted upon by what we call an unbalanced force. Let\'s break this law down by defining some key terms. Velocity is the speed of an object in a specified direction. An <span class="textLessonLink"><a class="external" href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/unbalanced-force-definition-example-quiz.html">unbalanced force</a></span> is an external force that changes the motion of an object. When an object is at rest or moving at a constant velocity, all the forces acting on it are balanced. ']
